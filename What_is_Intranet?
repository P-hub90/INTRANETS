# What is an Intranet?

An intranet is a private network that exists inside a company or organization. Think of it like a small, internal version of the internet that only the people who work at the company can access. 

It’s used for sharing information, resources, and tools that employees need for their daily work. For example, an intranet might have documents, company policies, news, or internal tools that everyone in the company can use, but only if they’re logged in to the network.

The intranet is a way to make sure everyone in the company has access to the same information, making work more efficient and helping teams stay connected.

### Why Does It Matter?

- **Collaboration**: Employees can easily share files, updates, and ideas.
- **Efficiency**: People can access company resources without needing to search the internet.
- **Security**: It’s private, meaning only employees can access sensitive company data.

In short, an intranet is like a private online workspace for the company!
